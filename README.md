# Ruby on Rails - Online Store
An online store template built using Ruby on Rails. Basic functions include: log in, sign up, logout, authentication from third party service, admin controls, purchasing options, class-level scope methods, Activerecord models with validations and more. 
Update 5/29/2019 - This application now showcases the ability to use javascript to make changes to your page dynamically. You will notice a lot of the buttons you press will not change the current URL, as it used to, but still changes the view of the page. This is done by removing and appending elements as necessary, depending on the action of the button.

## Installation
run `bundle install`
run `rake db:migrate`
run `rake db:seed

## Usage
run `rails s` to start up server and go to the URL it provides you
Sign in with the admin account {username: admin, password: admin}, to make edits or changes to any of the online store items. Create your own account to 'purchase' items or make reviews on any given item.
